# Achieve Goal Overlay

**Description:**
Achieve is a easy to use goal/to-do overlay for all games and apps.

**Features:**
- **Add A Checkbox:** Add your goal such as completing a mission, and be able to check it once complete.

- **Add A Value:** Add your goal such as amount of kills, and be able to change the value at any time.

- **Quick Display:** Add any goals to an extra menu which will display at all times while you're playing.

- **Based on Overlook:** This overlay is based on my other overlay, [Overlook](https://github.com/ji8sw/Overlook).

**Usage:**
Install the correct executable based on your architecture (x86 for 32 bit & x64 for 64 bit operating systems), run the executable, there is no setup required for this tool and a menu will appear, here you can add and control your goals, at any time, press insert to close this menu, this won't close the Quick Display. Your monitor's resolution doesn't matter.

**Safety And Discretion:**
Achieve is a very safe application, this is due to its externality, Achieve doesn't rely on the game you're playing, the game will have no idea, however, if in the case you do face consequences, always remember that you're the one who put your account at risk.
